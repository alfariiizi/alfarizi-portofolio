# Alfarizi's Portofolio

This is the git of my portofolio. You can visit the live site here: <https://alfariiizi.github.io/alfarizi-portofolio/>. Inside of the site, it contains profile of myself, personal proyek that I have developed, and tools that I use. I built this site using _javascript_ with library _reactjs_. I also use _tailwindcss_ to style the site.
